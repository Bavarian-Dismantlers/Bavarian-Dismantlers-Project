      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Bavarian Dismantlers is a father-and-son automotive recycling project based in Colorado, 
        focused on tearing down German vehicles and re-homing OEM parts from brands like Porsche, 
        BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen. Every component we sell is backed by photo 
        evidence, video walkarounds, and diagnostic logs so you know exactly what you’re getting.
      </p>
      <p>
        This digital portfolio is more than just a pile of images &amp; links. It is a
        traceable record of each vehicle’s condition from first cold start to final teardown. 
        Our goal is to make buying used OEM parts as predictable and trustworthy as buying new.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we expand, future projects will follow the same standard: clear documentation,
        organized media, and honest representation of every part we pull.
